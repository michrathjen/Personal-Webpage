<CENTER><H1>Research Interests - 
Mathematical Logic and Combinatorics</H1></CENTER>

<P><BR>
My main interests are:<br>
<ul>
<LI>frameworks for constructivism (constructive set theory, explicit
mathematics, Martin-L&ouml;f type theory);
<LI>proof theory (principally ordinal analyses of theories);
<LI>set theory (chiefly admissible set theory and large "cardinals" in
constructive set theory); 
<LI>combinatorial principles (Kruskal's theorem,...).
</ul>

 <H3>Proof Theory</H3>Proof theory includes the following topics:
      infinitary proof theory and ordinal analysis, proof transformations and
      program synthesis, and connections with subrecursive complexity.
      <P>There is a fundamental question which, since the pioneering
      contributions of G&ouml;del, Gentzen and Herbrand over fifty years ago, has
      motivated the continued development of that area of Mathematical Logic
      known as "Proof Theory", and which now drives much present-day activity in
      Theoretical Computer Science, namely "What is the information content of a
      constructive formal proof and how can it be read off ?" or, more
      specifically, "How is it possible to synthesize programs from formal
      proofs of their specifications , and hence classify and compare them - and
      the functions which they compute - according to their proof -theoretic
      complexity ?"
      <P>If, from a formal proof of the specification, it were possible
      effectively to extract or synthesize a program P which satisfies it, then
      the program would automatically be a "verified" one. If, in addition, it
      were possible to read off from the proof, bounds on the existential
      theorems occurring in it, this would provide an effective way of
      estimating the complexity of P. If this connection between proofs and
      programs were sufficiently close, then "natural" transformations on proofs
      would correspond to natural program transformations. Mathematical logic
      provides theoretical realizations of these possibilities, based on the
      deep and well known correspondence which exists between proof-rules and
      recursive program-constructs.
